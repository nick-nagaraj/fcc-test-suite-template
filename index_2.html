    <h2 align = "left"> About </h2>
      </u>
      <p>Richard Phillips Feynman (May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965.</p>

<p>Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.</p>

<p>He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think? and books written about him such as Tuva or Bust! by Ralph Leighton and the biography Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick. </p>

      <p>The Feynman path integral states that quantum mechanics is based off of the classical Lagrangian formulation of theories, but one where you weight the different paths between points. The principle of least action from classical mechanics arises out of the mathematical approximation known as the stationary phase approximation. The Feynman path integral has numerous implications, the biggest of which is that you can formulate quantum mechanical theories in a Lorentz invariant manner rather than the canonical commutation approach where Lorentz invariance is a miracle that occurs. </p>

<p>The second achievement of Feynman are Feynman diagrams. Before Feynman, basically no one could do relativistic quantum mechanical calculations because they were too technically difficult. Feynman gave an approximation technique that let ordinary physicists do calculations. This technique is how we still do calculations to this day, although there are some cracks in the wall showing that this formulation may be over-complicating the underlying quantum mechanical behavior of theories.</p>

<p>The third achievement, for which he won the Nobel Prize, was showing that quantum electrodynamics is a consistent relativistic theory of electromagnetic interactions and matched the predictions observed in experiment. The primary challenge was the appearance of divergences in the quantum calculations. The whole procedure of renormalization was a great achievement even if it was another three decades before it was properly understood — these theories could have been thrown away for that interim period, possibly delaying physics for 30 to 50 years. Feynman shared this Nobel Prize with Julian Schwinger and Sin'ichirō Tomonaga who also made the same achievements near contemporaneously, and Freeman Dyson was heavily involved with this achievement.</p>
